// Package echo holds the presenter interfaces to use with the echo framework
//
// It is recommended to use a granularity of one file per base resource;
// for instance for /api/todo/v1/todos we would have the `todo_presenter.go`,
// for /api/todo/v1/calendars we would have the `calendar_presenter.go`, and
// so on.
