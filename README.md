TODO:
- Update the title
- Update the summary below about the API you are
  implementing.

The goal of this repository is to inspire a getting
started golang microservice which use a design first
approach and provide a productive way to create
resources for the API.

## Getting started

- **Pre-requisites**

```sh
# Install required packages
$ sudo dnf install git golang make podman podman-compose delve

# Create and edit the file confis/config.yaml
$ cp -vf configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.yaml

# Install local tools
$ make tidy
$ make install-tools

# Build all the requirements and start the local infra
$ make compose-build compose-clean clean build compose-up
```

Day to day:

- Start the service: `make run`
- Run some test request by: `./test/sripts/todos-list.sh`
- Run tests by: `make test` or `make test-unit` or `make test-integration`

- Open apicurio to load, edit and save the openapi specification
  by: `make apicurio-start`

If you want to use TDD, then start implementing some tests to fail, and
cover every small change. Run tests by `test`, `test-unit` or `test-integration`
make rules and add the necessary code.

## Repository layout

```raw
/api - Contain all the APIs
  /http - Contain the openapi specification.
  /event - Contain json schema to define the event formats.
/internal
  /data - the database model
  /handler - the http and event handlers
    /http
    /event
  /infrastructure
    All the code directly related with
    frameworks and libraries.
  /interface
    The interfaces for presenter, interactor and
    repositories are stored here.
    /presenter
      Adapter between the framework and the
      business logic independent code; every
      http handler and middleware has a
      presenter that wrap the interactor.
    /repository
      Data input/output of the system.
      /client
        /http
        /event
      /db
      /s3
    /interactor
      Free form layout to represent the business
      logic; this is framework independent.
  /usecase
    Same layout that interface, with the implementation.
  /test
    Test helper, mocks, integration tests.
    /mock
    /integration - Hold all the integration tests.
    /builder
      /db
      /api
/test
  /data
    /http
    /event
  /scripts
  /http
